Proj 02-03: Zooming and Shrinking Images by Pixel Replication

	resultedImage = resizeImage_replication (originalImage, scalingFactor)

	resultedImage is output image matrix. 
	originalImage is input image matrix. 
	scalingFactor is scaling factor.
	
	ex.
	X = 2 * 3 image matrix.
	resizeImage_replication (X, 2) = 4 * 6 image matrix.
	
Proj 02-04: Zooming and Shrinking Images by Bilinear Interpolation
	
	resizedImage = resizeImage_bilinear(originalImage, scalingFactor)

	resultedImage is output image matrix. 
	originalImage is input image matrix. 
	scalingFactor is scaling factor.
	
	ex.
	X = 2 * 3 image matrix.
	resizeImage_replication (X, 2) = 4 * 6 image matrix.
